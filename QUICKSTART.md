## Philosophy & Meaning

This game is about **psychological integration**, not defeating enemies. Each villain represents a fear-based aspect of yourself:

- **Rejection** ‚Üí Need for validation
- **Failure** ‚Üí Perfectionism
- **Invisibility** ‚Üí Narcissistic compensation
- **Loneliness** ‚Üí Fear of connection
- **Death** ‚Üí Fear of impermanence

When you **integrate** rather than destroy these aspects, you gain their wisdom and power. This mirrors Jungian shadow work and psychedelic integration practices.

**Remember**: There are no enemies, only parts of yourself to embrace.

*"Descend into your fears. Rise through your mind."*
