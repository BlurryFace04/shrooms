# 🍄 Shroom Odyssey: Journey Through the Inner Shadows

*"Descend into your fears. Rise through your mind."*

A psychedelic side-scrolling adventure game where you journey through the landscape of human consciousness, confronting core fears and integrating shadow selves.

## 🎮 Game Concept

Each level represents a fundamental human fear or insecurity. Navigate through six transformative stages, from the Hall of Mirrors to the Garden of Ego Death, where enemies become allies and fears transform into wisdom.

## 🌟 Features

### Six Fear Levels
1. **The Hall of Mirrors** - Fear of Rejection (vs. The Siren of Validation)
2. **The Tower of Perfection** - Fear of Failure (vs. The Overlord of Perfection)
3. **The Narcissist's Kingdom** - Fear of Not Being Seen (vs. The Narcissist King)
4. **The Labyrinth of Isolation** - Fear of Loneliness (vs. The Shadow of Solitude)
5. **The Abyss of the Void** - Fear of Death (vs. The Void Beast)
6. **The Garden of Ego Death** - Transcendence (No enemies, only reflections)

### Hero Archetypes (Spirit Guides)
- **The Fool** - Teaches playfulness and letting go
- **The Warrior** - Embodies willpower and resilience
- **The Sage** - Provides clarity and wisdom
- **The Lover** - Shows compassion and self-acceptance

### Mind Bloom Powers
