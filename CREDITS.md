## Final Thoughts

This game was created with:
- üß† Respect for psychological depth
- üéÆ Love for meaningful gameplay
- üçÑ Appreciation for altered states
- üíú Compassion for the human struggle
- ‚ú® Hope for transformation

If this game helped you think about yourself differently, scared you a little, made you curious, or simply entertained you for an hour - then it succeeded.

May you integrate your shadows.  
May you find peace with your fears.  
May you remember: you are not the darkness or the light.  
You are the awareness that contains both.
